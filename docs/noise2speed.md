     An all-encompassing single function for car cabin noise based on speed is not possible, as the noise is a complex phenomenon derived from multiple sources.
     Instead, a composite model is used, with different noise sources dominating at different speed ranges.
     The total noise level is the logarithmic sum of these component noises.
     A simplified model for cabin noise level, \(L_{total}\) (in dBA), as a function of vehicle speed, \(v\), can be represented as:\(L_{total}(v)=10\cdot \log _{10}(10^{L_{engine}(v)/10}+10^{L_{tire}(v)/10}+10^{L_{wind}(v)/10})\)This is a simplified version of the models used in automotive engineering, as other factors like road surface, vehicle make, and tire type also play a significant role.
     Key noise components as functions of speed Engine noise, \(L_{engine}(v)\) At low speeds (below 40–50 km/h), engine noise is a dominant contributor to cabin sound.
     It is a complex function of engine speed (RPM) and load, which are both related to the vehicle's speed and gear selection.
     Behavior: Engine noise increases approximately linearly with speed in a specific gear.
     actors: The type of engine (e.
     .
      diesel vs.
     gasoline, conventional vs.
     hybrid), exhaust system, and engine mounts all influence the magnitude and frequency of the sound.
     For hybrid or electric vehicles, engine noise is often negligible or absent at low speeds.
     unction form: The engine noise component can be modeled as a linear or polynomial function of speed, \(v\).
     (L_{engine}(v)=a_{0}+a_{1}v+\dots \) Tire-road interaction (rolling) noise, \(L_{tire}(v)\) As speed increases, rolling noise, caused by the friction and interaction between the tires and the road surface, becomes a major contributor.
     Behavior: This noise component typically increases logarithmically with speed.
     actors: The texture of the road surface, type of tire (compound, tread pattern), and proper wheel alignment significantly impact this noise.
     unction form: Rolling noise can be modeled as a logarithmic function of speed.
     (L_{tire}(v)=b_{0}+b_{1}\cdot \log _{10}(v)\) Aerodynamic (wind) noise, \(L_{wind}(v)\) At higher speeds (above 70 km/h), wind noise from air turbulence around the vehicle's body and through door and window seals becomes dominant.
     Behavior: Wind noise increases with the square or cube of vehicle speed.
     actors: Vehicle aerodynamics, body shape (e.
     .
      SUVs often have more wind noise than sedans), and the condition of door and window seals are critical.
     unction form: Wind noise can be modeled as a power function of speed, potentially with an exponential term.
     (L_{wind}(v)=c_{0}+c_{1}v^{2}\) Combining the components The composite function would involve finding the appropriate coefficients for each term based on vehicle testing.
     Engineers use specialized equipment to measure Noise, Vibration, and Harshness (NVH) levels at different speeds on various road surfaces to create an accurate model for a specific car.
     At low speeds, the engine noise term is larger.
     As speed increases, the logarithmically increasing tire noise and exponentially increasing wind noise begin to dominate, with wind noise becoming the most significant at highway speeds.
     The total function therefore reflects a shift in which noise source is most influential as speed changes.
